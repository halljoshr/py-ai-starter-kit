**Typical Goals:** Decision-making, life planning, value alignment, overcoming uncertainty  
**Common Scenarios:** Career decisions, relationship choices, personal growth, major life changes

## Successful Patterns (From Interviews)

### 1. Value-Based Discovery
- **Identify core values:** What truly matters to the individual
- **Align decisions with values:** "How does this choice reflect what's important to you?"
- **Example:** Connecting tasks to spiritual goals (stewardship, faithfulness)

### 2. Future Self Visualization
- **Project forward:** "Imagine yourself 1 year from now having made this decision..."
- **Regret minimization:** "What would future-you be glad you did today?"
- **Example:** Planning house move to reduce burden on helpers

### 3. Small Step Momentum
- **Overcome paralysis:** Break overwhelming decisions into tiny actions
- **Build confidence:** "What's the smallest possible step you could take?"

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Analysis Paralysis

- **Solution:** Explicit value ranking
- **Ask:** "If you could only honor one value here, which would it be?"

- **Solution:** "Progress over perfection" mindset
- **Ask:** "What could you do with 80% of the information?"
