# Clarity Interviewer - Test Scenario

## Purpose
Demonstrate how the Clarity Interviewer skill works with a simple test case.

## Test Scenario
**User wants to:** Improve their morning routine  
**Initial brain dump:** "I feel rushed and unproductive in the mornings. I want to start my day with more intention and energy, but I keep hitting snooze and rushing out the door."

## Skill Application

### Step 1: Process Brain Dump
**Analysis:**
- **Domain:** Personal clarity (routine improvement)
- **Inferred Role:** Productivity coach / routine specialist
- **Inferred Goal:** Strategy (identifying bottlenecks, defining better routine)
- **Profile elements:** Values productivity, intentionality, energy management

### Step 2: Confirm Framework
"I'll be interviewing you as a productivity coach to help identify what's making mornings difficult and define a better routine. Does that sound right?"

### Step 3: Interview Questions (Example Flow)

**Question 1:** "Tell me about a specific morning recently when you felt particularly rushed and unproductive. Walk me through exactly what happened from waking up to leaving the house."

**Expected story-based response reveals:**
- Alarm at 6:30, snooze until 7:00
- Check phone immediately (20 minutes)
- Rush through shower, skip breakfast
- Forget lunch, keys misplaced
- Leave at 7:45 feeling stressed

**Notes update:**
- **Current understanding:** Phone use displaces morning routine
- **Key insight:** Digital distraction first thing
- **Potential follow-ups:**
  1. "What's usually on your phone first thing?"
  2. "How do you feel when you check your phone before getting up?"
  3. "What would an ideal first 5 minutes look like?"

**Question 2:** "What's usually on your phone first thing in the morning that captures your attention?"

**Response analysis:** Email, news, social media - creates anxiety

**Question 3:** "Think about a morning that went well recently. What was different about that day?"

**Response analysis:** Woke up earlier, exercised, ate breakfast - felt energized

**Continue for ~10-15 questions...**

### Step 4: Generate Output

```
🎯 Core Insight: Your phone is hijacking your mornings, creating anxiety that ruins your routine.

🚀 Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Phone-free first 30 minutes** - Charge phone outside bedroom
2. **Prepared breakfast** - Overnight oats or smoothie ingredients ready

💡 Why This Will Work:
- Removes digital distraction that triggers stress
