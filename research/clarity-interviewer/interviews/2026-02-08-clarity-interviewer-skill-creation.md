# Interview: Clarity Interviewer Skill Creation

**Date:** 2026-02-08  
**Interviewer:** Gabriel (AI Assistant)  
**Interviewee:** Jonathan LaRiviere  
**Domain:** Skill Development / Software Discovery  
**Goal:** Extract requirements and design for Clarity Interviewer skill

## Initial Brain Dump
Jonathan wanted to create a skill based on the "Don't Prompt AI. Let It Prompt You." methodology. He had experienced an "extremely enlightening" interview that pulled out insights he "didn't even know were relevant." The technique uses Teresa Torres' story-based interview method and revealed concepts like target date vs due date separation and spiritual dimensions of tasks.

## Interview Summary (17 Questions)

### Key Insights Discovered:

1. **Core Value:** The skill should draw out insights users don't realize they know, revealing hidden relevance and increasing success chances.

2. **Methodology:** Four-layer framework (Role, Goal, Mechanic, Guardrails) with story-based questioning.

3. **Architecture:** 
   - Modular domain system (software-discovery, personal-clarity, etc.)
   - Living domain documents that grow with experience
   - Profile-driven customization (not hardcoded modules)
   - Portable design for any AI system

4. **Process:**
   - Infer framework from brain dump
   - One question at a time, dynamically adapted
   - Explorer mindset - follow rabbit trails
   - Natural conclusion based on completeness

5. **Integration:**
   - Auto-save interview transcripts
   - Update domain files post-interview
   - Generate appropriate outputs (plans, documentation, tasks)
   - Continuous improvement system

### Design Decisions:

1. **No model selection** - Keep simple, model-agnostic
2. **No hardcoded spirituality** - Profile-driven customization
3. **Flexible length** - Natural conclusion, not rigid 30 questions
4. **Speech-friendly** - Works well with dictation tools
5. **Transferable** - Portable to Claude Code and other systems

## Output Generated: Complete Skill Design

### Phase 1: Core Skill Creation
- SKILL.md with 4-layer framework
- Note-taking system with explorer mindset
- Domain inference from brain dump
- Profile building mechanism

### Phase 2: Domain System
- Directory structure for domains
- Initial broad domains
- Domain file loading and updating

### Phase 3: Integration & Portability
- OpenClaw compatibility
- File export system
- Interview archiving
- Output generation

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- Real scenario testing
- Domain file refinement
- Profile inference optimization
- User feedback collection

### Phase 5: Continuous Improvement
- Post-interview analysis
- Pattern extraction
- Success metric tracking
- Community sharing

## Success Metrics Identified
- **Insights revealed:** Number of "aha moments"
- **Clarity gained:** User's self-reported understanding increase  
- **Actionability:** Concrete next steps generated
- **User satisfaction:** "This drew out things I didn't know I knew"

## Files Created from This Interview

1. `SKILL.md` - Complete skill documentation
2. `domains/software-discovery.md` - First domain file
3. `domains/personal-clarity.md` - Second domain file  
4. `templates/story-based-questions.md` - Teresa Torres methodology
5. `TEST_INTERVIEW.md` - Demonstration scenario
6. `QUICK_START.md` - User guide
7. `INTERVIEW_NOTES.md` - Raw interview notes

## Domain File Updates Needed
- **software-discovery.md:** Add this interview as case study
- **personal-clarity.md:** Add profile-building patterns
- **New domain:** skill-development.md (for future skill creation interviews)

## Skill Improvement Insights
1. **Interview about skill creation** itself was valuable - consider making this a pattern
2. **Profile inference worked well** - brain dump provided sufficient context
3. **Natural conclusion detection** - interview ended when design was complete
4. **Rabbit trail following** - integration discussion was valuable tangent

## Next Actions
1. Test skill with real scenarios
2. Refine domain files based on usage
3. Consider creating skill-development domain
4. Share skill with community for feedback

## User Feedback
Jonathan: "I am so excited. Please start building!"  
Value recognized: "This will draw insights from any user... things they didn't even realize they knew."
