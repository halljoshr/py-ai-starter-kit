After the interview, create a step by step plan to get from Point A to Point B (but not Point Z). Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 2:59 AM] Perfect. Let's begin the interview. I'll create a notes file and ask one question at a time. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 2:59 AM] Question 1: What is the single most frustrating thing about your current task management system (Apple Reminders + whatever else you use)? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:13 AM] The single most frustrating thing about my current task management system is that it feels like there's a ton of friction. I have to manage the lists and the organizations within the lists, and so prioritization is difficult. What should I work on now? And I don't have the ability to give myself enough context in the moment to figure that out. Apple Reminders just gives me due dates. It doesn't even have the concept of do on this date vs. a due by date. like there is a deadline, but also a date that I want to do it on. But again, the most important thing is prioritization, and if I give an AI executive assistant like yourself access to all of the context it needs for every task, then it can help me prioritize Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:14 AM] Question 2: When you look at your list of tasks right now, what specific information do you WISH you had about each task to help you decide what to work on next? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:17 AM] When I look at my list of tasks, I wish that I could see the next one or two things that I need to do to make progress in that task, as well as the deadline and the consequences for not meeting that deadline, as well as its position and priority in relation to other tasks. I need to know that this is the most important task that I need to work on right now. And I need to know why. If a system is developed that I can trust, I will less need to know why, because I will just trust that the system knows why. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:17 AM] Let me read the current file and update it properly: Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:17 AM] Question 3: Think about a task you completed recently that felt satisfying and efficient. What made it work well? What role did any system or tool play in that success? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:24 AM] The tasks that I complete that are satisfying and efficient are typically the ones like taking the garbage out where I get a reminder and I know that I have a deadline very close and it's a short task. It doesn't require any extra mental effort on my part because the task is very straightforward and I know exactly what I need to do to accomplish it. Tonight I did a task that I was putting it off, but I did accomplish it efficiently because the deadline is tomorrow. It was to get Elijah on my insurance and to figure out what to do with that situation. So I just opened my computer and started a conversation with two different LLM models that went back and forth and finally found an answer. Having conversations like this in telegram has helped me to keep some of my tasks more top of mind because I know that they're going into a system, and I can ask OpenClaw to produce the task in any notes whenever I ask it. It also has been sending me frequent reminders of those tasks in priority order, so I think about it more often Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:24 AM] Question 4: When a task feels overwhelming or you procrastinate on it, what's usually missing? Is it clarity on next steps, not understanding the importance, something else? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:29 AM] In my estimation, it does seem to have to do with clarity on next steps, but especially that I get overwhelmed with analysis by paralysis or paralysis by analysis because I am often anxious that there is something more important that I could be working on. Now there is also the human flaw of mental laziness, and I don't want to put in the effort at the time to think about it. So some of that mental effort could be offloaded to be done much earlier. I could do that thinking when I put in the task, and not then have to rely on myself to do that thinking when I load up the task into my short-term memory when it comes in as a reminder or as a notification. One thing to note about this question, though, is that experts like Teresa Torres want interviewers to be very careful not to use generic questions. Story-based interviews that are grounded in actual, real historical events are going to be far more reliable than asking in general, "What do you do normally in situation X?" You're more likely to get relevant answers from me doing it this way Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:29 AM] Question 5: Tell me about a specific time recently when you faced analysis paralysis with a task. What was the task, what made it overwhelming, and how did you eventually move forward (or not)? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:34 AM] I face analysis paralysis when I get notifications from OpenClaw about some of the one-off ideas or maybe even important tasks that I started (like security hardening OpenClaw or moving OpenClaw to a different user or container). These things seem important so that I can reduce my security vulnerabilities, but I also don't know where to start, and I'm not confident that my AI can steer us in the right direction given my knowledge. But I'm sure it could figure it out. Again, it's more that I see a simple task title and I don't know where to go next. I don't know if it's important now. I'm typically coming to my task list or this OpenClaw Telegram conversation because I have an idea or something else I want to work on, and then I see those things and I'm not ready to work on them because I have something else more important itching in the back of my mind. So I want to work on those things Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:35 AM] Question 6: When you have that "something else more important itching in the back of your mind," what form does that take? Is it a specific task, a project, a feeling, or something else? How do you currently capture or address that "itch"? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:37 AM] Sometimes that itch in the back of my mind is strong and made stronger because I see a task in front of me that I don't know what to do with or how to prioritize it. I might be worried that I'm going to do it wrong or get it wrong and I don't have enough information or planning or research. OpenClaw has helped me research tasks and projects, it has made me feel more empowered about that. I really want to be able to trust OpenClaw and anything that it produces. And so the system needs to be very resilient. Another way that itch shows itself is I see a task that I know has an importance but the importance is not critical. So I think I should work on something else that is critical and so I never go to work on the moderately important. This seems more like a human flaw in failure which is something that our system and software should take into consideration Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:38 AM] Question 7: You mentioned wanting to trust OpenClaw. What would need to be true about the system for you to fully trust its task prioritization and recommendations? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:40 AM] The system would need to account for all of these things so that I could consistently trust it. This means that all of the prerequisites for a task to be finished, all of the prerequisites for a task or project to be outlined and defined would need to be done beforehand. Then I would know that whenever I am being suggested things to work on, I know it's based on solid context. This doesn't mean OpenClaw has to read every task every single time, but it does mean when OpenClaw gets the context it needs to get to understand the fullness of the task or project, it needs to then use all of that context to put it in the list of priorities properly Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:41 AM] Question 8: When you add a new task to Apple Reminders right now, what information do you typically include? What information do you WISH you included but often skip because it's too much effort? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:44 AM] Right now, the maximum I give it is to say, "Remind me to do this task on this day." And that's it. That means that on that day, I'll be reminded to do that task. But it might be a task that is actually due a week out or three weeks out because it doesn't have a concept to differentiate those two. things I wish I could include things about why it's important and how to help me decide how to prioritize it. A part of me wishes I could be interviewed about the task so that context that I may not think to give in the moment is then given in the moment. I definitely skip using the built-in Apple reminders feature for priority and notes, because even those things alone seen in a list will not help me prioritize against projects and tasks in other lists that I can't even see in that part of the interface. This is the problem with separating tasks into different lists inside of Apple reminders, even though this is an incredibly helpful feature, it also creates this friction. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:45 AM] Question 9: Imagine you're adding a task and the system says: "Tell me about this task." What 3-5 questions would be most helpful for it to ask you to capture the right context for future prioritization? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:49 AM] I am not an expert in task management, project management, and how all of this relates to the human condition, so I would expect that proper research could be done on this question that could accurately create that list. I will still do my best to help answer this question. I would expect to be asked about the anticipated list of steps that would be needed to accomplish the task. That would help me flush out the details, and I can add even more context for each of those steps. Then, my software could help me decide what projects to create and what tasks to create and how those depend upon one another. I think dependencies are another very important part of context that I don't know how to communicate to Apple Reminders or other project management tasks without significant overhead and administration. I would also expect to be asked about: • The unknowns about the task • What dependencies might exist before starting the task • My goals that I want to get out of accomplishing this task • Questions I know that I need to answer along the way in order to get to a successful outcome for the task Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:49 AM] Question 10: Think about the last time you completed a multi-step task or project. How did you track what needed to be done next? What worked well and what was frustrating about that process? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:56 AM] The last time I accomplished a multi-step task, I used Obsidian with a markdown file to track the steps and notes that I needed along the way. However, when I finished the Elijah insurance task, all of the context was luckily able to be contained within a single AI chat conversation. From start to finish, I was able to keep the context there and not need to go elsewhere. That's because it had a pretty simple goal: to answer the question should I add my son to my insurance? And if so, do I add him to my current plan or downgrade to the high deductible plan? AI can do so much of the research for me and already has so much of that knowledge and reasoning. Because I have free access to very powerful models, in this case, I used Gemini 3 Pro in Google AI Studio and also used Grok Heavy. Another example was planning for the purchase and move into our new house. I opened up an Escala Draw file inside of Obsidian and drew out a calendar with the plan for cleaning and moving and packing and the dates that were relevant. That was my artifact that I used in order to plan the purchase of home insurance and plan the packing and planning out the official move-in date, which then allowed me to send messages out to my friends to ask them to help me. I was able to get plenty of help from all my friends because of the planning that I did and the communication in advance had I procrastinated, I would have been left with very little help which would have been a disservice and unloving to the very few people who would have been available to help me. It was actually loving to those people to plan ahead, reach out, and get enough help so that they all had very light loads. That is a key principle of what I am aiming for. This system we're building in tool is going to allow me to be a good steward of God's gifts to me and will especially allow me to be loving to my wife as I take on the administration of this home as the head of this home. It will allow me to be loving to others in all of the ways that I interact with them and in all of the systems that we interact with. For example, managing the church, cleaning, scheduling the better I can do and more proactive I can be about that, especially with a tool like this. The more that I can bless them and ease the burden on them, and the better this tool can be, the less burden it will be on me, and the more burdens that I can take on. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 3:57 AM] Question 11: You mentioned the system should help you be "loving to your wife as head of home administration." What specific aspects of home administration cause the most friction or stress currently? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:04 AM] This question is excellent, and is really going to help me communicate well when it comes to what I need help with. One of the primary aspects of home administration that causes the most friction and stress is just managing our daily schedule and making sure we have enough time to do all of the things that would help us lead a God-honoring life. That includes: • Waking up at a good time • Going to bed at a good time • Exercising together • Reading, studying, and praying separately in a part • Helping my wife remember when she needs to do things in advance, like reading books for book clubs or finishing her discipleship workbook. Well in advance of the discipleship meeting. I hope to be able to share this system with her as well, so that she can see just what she needs to do. Now that doesn't mean this system needs to work for two players, but it does mean that I could potentially clone this system for her. And then the two systems can interact in the same way that I can share Apple Reminders with her and share Apple Reminders lists with her. She needs to have relevant context of what we're working on and what she needs to do separate from what I'm doing and together with what I'm doing. Another point of friction is just making sure that I do the things at the right time with as much advance as possible. For example, I need to get a homestead exemption for our house, and it's not urgent, but I know it's important. Another important task is to mow the lawn, which is a little more urgent because the lawn is still growing and I haven't mowed it recently. Another example is cars and managing their registration and their maintenance and upkeep and being able to track that easily through a system that tells us when to do what. And then there are the many little honeydew tasks all around the house, like putting in door stoppers, like fixing the many doors that don't latch because the latches don't line up. Like putting in a security system. Like installing a doorbell. Like putting on the house numbers outside of the house. Like doing the change of address. And just making sure that all of those get done in the right orde. Oh, and we want to take regular walks together with our son for our relationship, but especially for our physical health. And we want to have opportunities to bless others in the ways that we have been blessed. That could include things like: • Hosting people for meals • Making meals and delivering meals to people • Sending gifts or cards through the mail • Calling people like my mom on a regular basis Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:04 AM] Question 12: When you think about "doing things at the right time with advance notice," what does "right time" mean? Is it based on deadlines, energy levels, time of day, dependencies, or something else? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:06 AM] Doing things at the right time means that it's done with plenty of time for the deadline, so that unexpected things that come up cannot derail it to go past the deadline. Dependencies are something very important as well. I think energy level and time of day might be important factors to consider, especially given that I do different tasks in the evening vs. in the morning. And I ask my wife to do different tasks during the day that might only be able to be done in the middle of the day, like calling a bank or something else like that where it has to be done while I'm working Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:06 AM] Question 13: You mentioned dependencies are "very important." Can you give a specific example of a task dependency in your life that's currently hard to track? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:07 AM] One that comes to mind is the homestead exemption. I actually don't know what I need to do for that, and so I would probably need to do some Googling and researching about that. That's more of a pre-task dependency. But I know there are other projects that will have dependencies within them or projects that are dependent on other projects like I had mentioned earlier, Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:08 AM] Question 14: When you need to research something like the homestead exemption, how do you currently track that research process? Where do notes go, and how do you ensure the actual task gets done after research? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:10 AM] I just remembered another example for question 13. That example was to mow the lawn, but I also needed to put together the lawnmower. But I also still need to go fill up the gas can with gas at the gas station. And a surprise dependency came up where they offered to send me a discharge chute, so I submitted the request for that and had to wait for that to come in. Now on to question 14. If I think through what I would do for the homestead exemption task, I would start by Googling the homestead exemption and finding out what was necessary. Then I might put whatever tasks I find into Apple Reminders, but those have no relation to each other as far as dependencies go. Sometimes I actually fall back to going in a text thread with my wife or with myself and just mapping it out there, sending it to myself if the task is relevant. Then I will type it in there and send it to her because then we both have context and it's kind of in my short-term memory. I don't find that system ideal, but it is better than nothing. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:10 AM] Question 15: You mentioned text threads with your wife for shared context. What makes that work better than other methods, even though it's not ideal? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:11 AM] What makes it work better than other methods is that I can put all of the details in one place, and because it's the current most important task I'm working on, it gets a special treatment by being put in that message thread with my wife. It's not ideal because I then have to keep that in my short-term and long-term memory that, "Hey, I have the context of that task in that text thread," and to be honest, sometimes I forget that it's there with her or it's there in my own personal text thread, and I won't remember until I stumble across that text thread again Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:11 AM] Question 16: If the system could automatically capture and organize that "text thread" style context for you, what would that look like? How would you want to access it later? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:12 AM] I'm really not sure what it would look like. I would want to access it when I had begun working on the task and maybe be able to see a little bit of it before I start working on the task Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:13 AM] Question 17: When you start working on a task, what's the first thing you typically need to know or remember about it? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:17 AM] This question is too generic. Feedback for you to remember is that using things like "generally," "typically," or "usually" can lead to unhelpful answers because humans are notoriously bad at answering those questions and giving useful answers. Remember this forever so that you are careful when interviewing me in the future. I will answer this as though you asked me: "When I started working on a task recently, what was the first thing I needed to know or remember about it?" When I started working on the Elijah insurance task today, I needed to remember where I left off. I then needed to think about where to navigate to. I then needed to think about what to do with the information and what my primary question and goal was. I then needed to think about all of the context that I would need to give to an LLM AI model to help me make a good decision, and so I had to piece by piece type out that context when I got to that step. Even though the question you asked me was generic, I do think this question gets at the heart of what the user interface will look like and what information you can present me. The user interface might be simply this chat conversation, but it could also be something hosted in a web browser. What I want to see is probably going to be the first thoughts that I have about any task as I spin it up into my context after I read the title. So we should be very opinionated and clear about what is shown in that at a glance view to bring me up to speed with context. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:17 AM] Question 18: Looking at the Elijah insurance example, if the system had captured your "first thoughts" as you worked, what specific pieces of information would have been most valuable to have pre-assembled for you? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:19 AM] It would have been helpful to know: • The prompt to give to the AI models were already prepared for me • The next step would have been to gather information about the costs of the insurance to go into those conversations with the AI models • To see the due date and how critical it was to get this done, but also how important it would be to get it done early • Since there are factors beyond my control, especially in insurance, that may delay things So maybe the specific pieces of information that would have been most valuable for me to have assembled would be: • The cost of insurance • My household income • My mortgage • Other factors that would go into solving this Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:19 AM] Question 19: Where does information like "household income" and "mortgage details" currently live? How do you access it when needed? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:20 AM] They are stored in spreadsheets and in HR portals, but I would be absolutely happy to keep all of those in a database or context files for our system to pull from and have access to Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:20 AM] Question 20: If the system could proactively remind you about tasks with all the context you need, how would you want those reminders delivered? (e.g., Telegram message, dashboard, notification, etc.) Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:21 AM] I would want those reminders delivered through: • Phone notification • Telegram message • Through the dashboard That would be always on in our house. I would be happy for other forms as well. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:21 AM] Question 21: You mentioned a dashboard "always on in our house." Where would this be located, and who needs to see it? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:22 AM] It would be located in our living room, in our TV, or on another TV that I have lying around somewhere else, put up, or maybe on a small iPad screen that I leave always on, but it'd be somewhere in our kitchen-dining-room-living-room area that is all one space. It is an open floor plan. my wife and I would be the ones who need to see it. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:22 AM] Question 22: What should someone see at a glance on this always-on dashboard? What's the most important information? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:24 AM] I'm not sure what someone should see at a glance just yet, except for those critical items that have deadlines. I think it would be nifty to have upcoming calendar events that are relevant to both me and Elizabeth. A small weather widget might also be helpful. Maybe a suggestion for what we can do based on the weather, like a walk or maybe an indoor workout. Or other things like that. I don't know. The possibilities are really endless. We could even cycle through the less important bits of information without cycling through the critical pieces. It would be nice to see proactive alerts about things that are coming up in the next weeks or months that we could get ahead on, like taxes for example coming up in two months. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:24 AM] Question 23: When you think about "proactive alerts about things coming up in weeks or months," what makes something worth alerting about that far in advance? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:27 AM] In the case of taxes, it would be helpful to be proactively prompted to start gathering tax information and start putting it all in one place and planning it out and giving context to my OpenCloth system. Because all of that takes time, and so it could be done in multiple steps, but it's stuff that needs to get done eventually, and it would be nice to not scramble at the very end. And so something that is worth alerting that far in advance is something that can cause significant stress like tax deadlines. There are probably other criteria as well. I don't know if this counts as proactivity in this sense, but things like scheduling my dentist appointment or calling the dentist to make sure they have my updated insurance information since I changed jobs. Or if someone's wedding is coming up that we have purchased their wedding gift. As a side note that is maybe unrelated to this question, I just remembered that we never sent out our wedding thank you cards, and we have been married for over one year and three months, almost one year and four months. And I believe it's because we lacked discipline and diligence, but also those could have been helped with a system like this Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:27 AM] Question 24: The wedding thank you cards example is telling. If the system had helped with that, what would it have needed to know and do? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:32 AM] It would have needed to plan out in advance the steps to take, and then help us make sure those steps were taken bit by bit, little by little, instead of trying to bite off huge chunks at a time like we usually do. A great example of this is what just happened. We, right now, live in a house we just bought. But, our lease is still active on our old place, our townhome. And so, before March 28th, we need to have everything moved out of there and cleaned and we had not done it yet, even though we moved into our house on December 20th over a month and a half ago. Now, we did have a child in between then and now, but we had not taken any steps to clean it in the month since our child was born. However, what happened recently was that we were contacted by our landlords and they told us they were gonna have somebody come look at our place to see if they want to lease it. And so, that gave us less than 48 hours to get over to the old place, get all the remaining stuff out of it and do a simple clean job on it. Now, the learning factor here comes in that my wife, my mother-in-law and my father-in-law spent about four or five hours taking care of all of that. However, that could have been split up among maybe seven different days of little trips back and forth. We only live five minutes away from our old place. And so, that is an example that truly typifies what our lives are like when it comes to getting things done. We are not diligent to do little by little. We wait for big things and then they take us by storm and they cause us stress. However, I don't want to be naive to assume that if we had every step planned out piece by piece that we would successfully do it. There's still the human element here where we are fickle creatures, where we are prone to laziness and slothfulness. And so, maybe there are more things that would help us to get there. I know part of it is going to be spiritual growth and maturity in each of us. That is very true. But what this means is the system that we build must also be flexible so that quick updates can be given about whether or not a step has been taken and then things need to reprioritize automatically Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:32 AM] Question 25: Given the human tendency toward "all or nothing" execution, what could the system do to make "little by little" progress more appealing or easier than waiting for crisis? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:34 AM] This question deserves a lot of thought and contemplation and discovery through this. We may not be able to answer this before we build something, but if we understand how not doing the little by little will impact us, that may have an effect. Also, if we're encouraged by Scripture by the Word of God, knowing that God wants us to have self-control and to bear fruit and to grow and to love others, we may be encouraged in the moment to do it. Maybe we need to be encouraged to be good stewards. We are quite motivated in this fashion, so maybe this is a big unlock - to understand how the task is reinforced by our love of God and how we want to serve Him, honor Him, and do all things for His glory, making the best use of the time because the days are evil. Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:35 AM] Question 26: How could the system help you see the connection between daily tasks and your spiritual goals of stewardship and honoring God? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:36 AM] There would need to be some sort of visual connection, perhaps: • A verse attached to the task • A category of faithfulness attached to the task • A category of spiritual maturity (like one of the fruits of the Spirit) Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:36 AM] Question 27: Looking back at all we've discussed, what's the ONE thing you wish the system would do for you that would make the biggest difference in your daily life? Jonathan LaRiviere, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:38 AM] The one thing I wish the system would do for me is have every task and every project prioritized in a list of recommended order with how and when to accomplish every step of that task. And why I should complete it on that day in that way. I also feel that I must add that the one thing I wish the system would do would be to reason with me the way that AI reasons with its users in a back-and-forth manner, just like we're talking here right now. It has been absolutely illuminating, and I am quite elated with how this conversation has gone Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:39 AM] Now let me create the step-by-step plan based on our interview: Gabriel OpenClaw, [Feb 6, 2026 at 4:39 AM] Perfect! This has been an incredibly illuminating interview. Let me summarize what we've discovered and the path forward: ![🎯](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f3af/32.png) Core Insight from Interview: You don't just need a task manager - you need a spiritually-integrated, AI-guided stewardship system that: 1. Captures full context through conversation (like we just did) 2. Provides trustworthy prioritization with clear "why" 3. Connects daily tasks to your faith and love for others 4. Helps with "little by little" execution instead of crisis mode ![🚀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f680/32.png) Immediate Next Step (Phase 1 - This Week): Build a Conversational Task Interview System: 1. Telegram bot that interviews you about new tasks 2. Asks: Steps, dependencies, importance, consequences, spiritual connection 3. Outputs: Prioritized list with "why this matters now" 4. Stores: Structured context for future reference Test with Real Task: We'll use "Submit hospital indemnity claim for January 5 admission" (Priority 1) as our first test case. ![💡](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f4a1/32.png) Why This Approach Will Work: • Reduces friction: Conversation is natural (you enjoyed this interview) • Builds trust: System shows its reasoning • Provides clarity: Answers "what should I work on now?" definitively • Connects to faith: Makes stewardship explicit ![📋](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f4cb/32.png) Today/Tomorrow Action: I'll create the Phase 1 prototype. When it's ready, we'll: 1. Add the hospital claim task through the interview 2. See the prioritized output 3. Adjust based on what works/doesn't This gets us from Point A (frustration with current systems) to Point B (trusted daily guidance). Would you like me to start building the Phase 1 prototype now, or would you prefer to review the complete interview notes first?
