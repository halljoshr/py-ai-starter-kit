# Domain: Software Discovery

## Domain Overview
**Purpose:** Discover requirements, pain points, and solutions for software products  
**Typical Goals:** Define features, identify user needs, create product roadmap  
**Common Scenarios:** New product ideation, feature prioritization, workflow improvement

## Successful Patterns (From Interviews)

### 1. Story-Based Discovery
- **Ask for specific situations:** "Tell me about the last time you tried to..."
- **Avoid generalizations:** No "usually," "generally," "typically"
- **Example success:** Revealed target date vs due date distinction

### 2. Spiritual Dimension Integration
- **For Jonathan:** Connect tasks to stewardship, honoring God
- **Ask:** "How does this task connect to your spiritual goals?"
- **Example:** Categorized tasks by spiritual goals (stewardship)

### 3. Dependency Mapping
- **Discover:** What needs to happen before other things
- **Ask:** "What needs to be true before you can start this?"
- **Example:** Lawn mowing dependencies (gas, assembly, discharge chute)

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Analysis Paralysis
- **Symptom:** User overwhelmed by options, can't decide next step
- **Solution:** Break into smallest possible next actions
- **Ask:** "What's the absolute smallest step you could take right now?"

### 2. Missing Context
- **Symptom:** Tasks lack "why" or importance context
- **Solution:** Explore consequences and values
- **Ask:** "What happens if this doesn't get done? Who is affected?"

### 3. All-or-Nothing Execution
- **Symptom:** Waiting for perfect conditions, then crisis mode
- **Solution:** "Little by little" philosophy
- **Ask:** "How could this be done in 15-minute chunks over a week?"

## Question Library

### Opening Questions
1. "What is the single most frustrating thing about your current system?"
2. "When you look at your workflow right now, what specific information do you WISH you had?"
3. "Think about a task you completed recently that felt satisfying. What made it work well?"

### Deep Dive Questions
4. "Tell me about a specific time recently when you faced [problem]. What was the situation?"
5. "When you have that 'something else itching in the back of your mind,' what form does it take?"
6. "What would need to be true for you to fully trust a system's recommendations?"

### Dependency Questions
7. "Can you give a specific example of a task dependency that's currently hard to track?"
8. "When you need to research something, how do you currently track that process?"
9. "Where does information like [specific detail] currently live? How do you access it?"

### Spiritual/Value Questions (For Jonathan)
10. "How could this task help you be more loving to your wife/family?"
11. "What spiritual goal does this task connect to? (Stewardship, faithfulness, etc.)"
12. "How does getting this done honor God or use your gifts well?"

## Case Studies

### Case 1: OneBoard OS Discovery (2026-02-06)
**Situation:** Jonathan frustrated with OpenClaw workflows, unsure next steps  
**Key Insights:**
- Target date vs due date distinction discovered
- Spiritual dimension of tasks revealed
- Need for "little by little" execution identified
- Trust requires full context capture

**Successful Questions:**
- "What is the single most frustrating thing about your current task management system?"
- "When you look at your list of tasks right now, what specific information do you WISH you had?"
- "Tell me about a specific time recently when you faced analysis paralysis."

**Outcome:** Step-by-step plan for conversational task interview system

### Case 2: Clarity Interviewer Skill Creation (2026-02-08)
**Situation:** Designing a skill based on successful interview methodology  
**Key Insights:**
- Core value is "drawing out insights users don't realize they know"
- Four-layer framework (Role, Goal, Mechanic, Guardrails)
- Modular domain system with living documents
- Profile-driven customization, not hardcoded modules

**Successful Questions:**
- "Based on your initial description, can you describe one specific insight from your previous experience with this interview method that surprised you?"
- "For this Clarity Interviewer skill, should we implement specific question templates or patterns?"
- "What specific domains or use cases do you envision for this skill?"

**Outcome:** Complete skill design with SKILL.md, domain files, templates, and implementation plan

**Learnings:**
- Interview about skill creation itself is valuable pattern
- Brain dump provides sufficient context for framework inference
- Natural conclusion detection works well
- Rabbit trail following (integration discussion) adds value

### Case 3: Elijah Insurance Decision
**Situation:** Complex insurance decision with deadline  
**Key Insights:**
- Research process contained in single AI chat
- Context gathering done piece by piece during conversation
- Deadline created urgency but also stress

**Learnings:**
- Users need pre-assembled context for complex decisions
- Cost, income, mortgage details should be readily accessible
- AI can handle research but needs proper framing

## Evolving Insights

### Latest Learnings (2026-02-08)
1. **Interview methodology itself** can be productized as skill
2. **Profile-driven customization** better than hardcoded modules
3. **Living documents** allow domain expertise to grow
4. **Explorer mindset** valuable for discovering hidden insights

### Patterns to Test
1. **Brain dump analysis** for framework inference
2. **Dynamic profile building** during interview
3. **Rabbit trail following** for unexpected discoveries
4. **Natural conclusion detection** vs fixed question count
