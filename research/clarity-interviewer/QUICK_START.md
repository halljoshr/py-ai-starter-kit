# Clarity Interviewer - Quick Start Guide

## What This Skill Does
Helps you discover insights you didn't know you had through dynamic, one-question-at-a-time interviewing.

## How to Use It

### Basic Format
```
You are an expert interviewer. [Optional: specific domain expertise]
I need help with [your challenge/situation].
[Your brain dump - describe your situation, what's hard, what you've tried]
Let's have an interview where you ask one question at a time.
```

### Example Starter
```
You are an expert interviewer specializing in software systems.
I don't feel like our current project management approach is working.
We have tasks everywhere - some in Apple Reminders, some in notes, some in our heads.
I want a unified system but don't know where to start.
Let's have an interview where you ask one question at a time.
```

## What Happens Next

1. **Skill analyzes** your brain dump
2. **Infers** domain, role, and goal
3. **Confirms** with you: "I'll interview you as [role] about [goal]. Correct?"
4. **Asks first question** (story-based: "Tell me about a specific time...")
5. **Continues** with one question at a time, each informed by your last answer
6. **Concludes naturally** when clarity achieved (~25-30 questions)
7. **Provides output** (insights, next steps, plan)

## Key Principles

### For Best Results:
1. **Use speech dictation** (Wispr Flow, Super whisper) - speaking reveals more than typing
2. **Be specific in stories** - "Tell me about the last time..." not "What do you usually..."
3. **Trust the process** - Let the interviewer guide the discovery
4. **Follow rabbit trails** - Unexpected insights often come from tangents

### What Makes It Magical:
- **Reveals unconscious knowledge** - Things you didn't know you knew
- **Discovers hidden relevance** - Connections you hadn't seen
- **Increases success chances** - Clearer understanding = better decisions

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Software/Product Discovery
```
You are an expert interviewer specializing in software systems.
I want to build [product idea] but don't know where to start.
[Describe what you want, who it's for, what problem it solves]
```

### 2. Personal Clarity
```
You are an expert interviewer.
I'm feeling stuck about [life decision/career choice/personal goal].
[Describe your situation, options, what's confusing]
```

### 3. Business Strategy

You are an expert business strategy interviewer.
My business is facing [challenge] and I need clarity on next steps.
[Describe business, challenge, what you've tried]
```
