# Areas that could be added/improved

1. Building out a full tests first deployment that helps the feature builds and know what tests need passed before it can commit/finish feature.
2. A better prime function that is more effiecent with our token usage. Right now on large codebases this can be pretty rough.



# Company issues

1. It feels like everyone is using AI but everyone is doing something different. 
    1. Cowork is in beta right now and can probably help out any not developers who work on files regularly.
1. All developers should use a similar-ish system if we are not going to say each person is in-charge of a particular project.
